The effects of the division of labour, in the general\n      business of society, will be more easily understood, by considering in\n      what manner it operates in some particular manufactures.

But in the way in which this business is now carried on, not\n      only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number\n      of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One\n      man draws out the wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth\n      points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make\n      the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a\n      peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by\n      itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a\n      pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations,\n      which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though\n      in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. I have\n      seen a small manufactory of this kind, where ten men only were employed,\n      and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct\n      operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but\n      indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when\n      they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a\n      day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling\n      size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of\n      forty-eight thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth\n      part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four\n      thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought\n      separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated\n      to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made\n      twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two\n      hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth, part\n      of what they are at present capable of performing, in consequence of a\n      proper division and combination of their different operations."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert in economics. Answer the user's question using only your knowledge from the fine-tuned content."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How does the division of labor differ between agriculture and manufacturing, and what implications does this have for the productivity and comparative advantage of wealthy versus poorer nations?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In every other art and manufacture, the effects of the division of labour\n      are similar to what they are in this very trifling one, though, in many of\n      them, the labour can neither be so much subdivided, nor reduced to so\n      great a simplicity of operation. The division of labour, however, so far\n      as it can be introduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable\n      increase of the productive powers of labour. The separation of different\n      trades and employments from one another, seems to have taken place in\n      consequence of this advantage. This separation, too, is generally carried\n      furthest in those countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and\n      improvement; what is the work of one man, in a rude state of society,\n      being generally that of several in an improved one. In every improved\n      society, the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer; the manufacturer,\n      nothing but a manufacturer. The labour, too, which is necessary to produce\n      any one complete manufacture, is almost always divided among a great\n      number of hands. How many different trades are employed in each branch of\n      the linen and woollen manufactures, from the growers of the flax and the\n      wool, to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen, or to the dyers and\n      dressers of the cloth! The nature of agriculture, indeed, does not admit\n      of so many subdivisions of labour, nor of so complete a separation of one\n      business from another, as manufactures. It is impossible to separate so\n      entirely the business of the grazier from that of the corn-farmer, as the\n      trade of the carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith. The\n      spinner is almost always a distinct person from the weaver; but the\n      ploughman, the harrower, the sower of the seed, and the reaper of the\n      corn, are often the same. The occasions for those different sorts of\n      labour returning with the different seasons of the year, it is impossible\n      that one man should be constantly employed in any one of them. This\n      impossibility of making so complete and entire a separation of all the\n      different branches of labour employed in agriculture, is perhaps the\n      reason why the improvement of the productive powers of labour, in this\n      art, does not always keep pace with their improvement in manufactures. The\n      most opulent nations, indeed, generally excel all their neighbours in\n      agriculture as well as in manufactures; but they are commonly more\n      distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former. Their\n      lands are in general better cultivated, and having more labour and expense\n      bestowed upon them, produce more in proportion to the extent and natural\n      fertility of the ground. But this superiority of produce is seldom much\n      more than in proportion to the superiority of labour and expense. In\n      agriculture, the labour of the rich country is not always much more\n      productive than that of the poor; or, at least, it is never so much more\n      productive, as it commonly is in manufactures. The corn of the rich\n      country, therefore, will not always, in the same degree of goodness, come\n      cheaper to market than that of the poor. The corn of Poland, in the same\n      degree of goodness, is as cheap as that of France, notwithstanding the\n      superior opulence and improvement of the latter country. The corn of\n      France is, in the corn-provinces, fully as good, and in most years nearly\n      about the same price with the corn of England, though, in opulence and\n      improvement, France is perhaps inferior to England. The corn-lands of\n      England, however, are better cultivated than those of France, and the\n      corn-lands of France are said to be much better cultivated than those of\n      Poland. But though the poor country, notwithstanding the inferiority of\n      its cultivation, can, in some measure, rival the rich in the cheapness and\n      goodness of its corn, it can pretend to no such competition in its\n      manufactures, at least if those manufactures suit the soil, climate, and\n      situation, of the rich country. The silks of France are better and cheaper\n      than those of England, because the silk manufacture, at least under the\n      present high duties upon the importation of raw silk, does not so well\n      suit the climate of England as that of France. But the hardware and the\n      coarse woollens of England are beyond all comparison superior to those of\n      France, and much cheaper, too, in the same degree of goodness. In Poland\n      there are said to be scarce any manufactures of any kind, a few of those\n      coarser household manufactures excepted, without which no country can well\n      subsist."}]}

A common smith, who,\n      though accustomed to handle the hammer, has never been used to make nails,\n      if, upon some particular occasion, he is obliged to attempt it, will\n      scarce, I am assured, be able to make above two or three hundred nails in\n      a day, and those, too, very bad ones. A smith who has been accustomed to\n      make nails, but whose sole or principal business has not been that of a\n      nailer, can seldom, with his utmost diligence, make more than eight\n      hundred or a thousand nails in a day. I have seen several boys, under\n      twenty years of age, who had never exercised any other trade but that of\n      making nails, and who, when they exerted themselves, could make, each of\n      them, upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day. The making of\n      a nail, however, is by no means one of the simplest operations. The same\n      person blows the bellows, stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion,\n      heats the iron, and forges every part of the nail: in forging the head,\n      too, he is obliged to change his tools. The different operations into\n      which the making of a pin, or of a metal button, is subdivided, are all of\n      them much more simple, and the dexterity of the person, of whose life it\n      has been the sole business to perform them, is usually much greater. The\n      rapidity with which some of the operations of those manufactures are\n      performed, exceeds what the human hand could, by those who had never seen\n      them, be supposed capable of acquiring."}]}

It is impossible to pass very\n      quickly from one kind of work to another, that is carried on in a\n      different place, and with quite different tools. A country weaver, who\n      cultivates a small farm, must lose a good deal of time in passing from\n      his loom to the field, and from the field to his loom. When the two trades\n      can be carried on in the same workhouse, the loss of time is, no doubt,\n      much less. It is, even in this case, however, very considerable. A man\n      commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment\n      to another. When he first begins the new work, he is seldom very keen and\n      hearty; his mind, as they say, does not go to it, and for some time he\n      rather trifles than applies to good purpose. The habit of sauntering, and\n      of indolent careless application, which is naturally, or rather\n      necessarily, acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change\n      his work and his tools every half hour, and to apply his hand in twenty\n      different ways almost every day of his life, renders him almost always\n      slothful and lazy, and incapable of any vigorous application, even on the\n      most pressing occasions. Independent, therefore, of his deficiency in\n      point of dexterity, this cause alone must always reduce considerably the\n      quantity of work which he is capable of performing."}]}

It is\n      unnecessary to give any example. I shall only observe, therefore, that the\n      invention of all those machines by which labour is so much facilitated and\n      abridged, seems to have been originally owing to the division of labour.\n      Men are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods of\n      attaining any object, when the whole attention of their minds is directed\n      towards that single object, than when it is dissipated among a great\n      variety of things. But, in consequence of the division of labour, the\n      whole of every man’s attention comes naturally to be directed towards some\n      one very simple object. It is naturally to be expected, therefore, that\n      some one or other of those who are employed in each particular branch of\n      labour should soon find out easier and readier methods of performing their\n      own particular work, whenever the nature of it admits of such improvement.\n      A great part of the machines made use of in those manufactures in which\n      labour is most subdivided, were originally the invention of common\n      workmen, who, being each of them employed in some very simple operation,\n      naturally turned their thoughts towards finding out easier and readier\n      methods of performing it. Whoever has been much accustomed to visit such\n      manufactures, must frequently have been shewn very pretty machines, which\n      were the inventions of such workmen, in order to facilitate and quicken\n      their own particular part of the work. In the first fire engines {this was\n      the current designation for steam engines}, a boy was constantly employed\n      to open and shut alternately the communication between the boiler and the\n      cylinder, according as the piston either ascended or descended. One of\n      those boys, who loved to play with his companions, observed that, by tying\n      a string from the handle of the valve which opened this communication to\n      another part of the machine, the valve would open and shut without his\n      assistance, and leave him at liberty to divert himself with his\n      play-fellows. One of the greatest improvements that has been made upon\n      this machine, since it was first invented, was in this manner the\n      discovery of a boy who wanted to save his own labour."}]}

Many\n      improvements have been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the\n      machines, when to make them became the business of a peculiar trade; and\n      some by that of those who are called philosophers, or men of speculation,\n      whose trade it is not to do any thing, but to observe every thing, and\n      who, upon that account, are often capable of combining together the powers\n      of the most distant and dissimilar objects in the progress of society,\n      philosophy or speculation becomes, like every other employment, the\n      principal or sole trade and occupation of a particular class of citizens.\n      Like every other employment, too, it is subdivided into a great number of\n      different branches, each of which affords occupation to a peculiar tribe\n      or class of philosophers; and this subdivision of employment in\n      philosophy, as well as in every other business, improves dexterity, and\n      saves time.
